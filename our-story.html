    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Soon after meeting in college at Western Illinois University in 1975, we knew we would raise a family together one day and would live as happily ever after as  Is realistically possible. We enjoy a very casual lifestyle, our happiest moments spent together and with family and friends!  Many of these moments are spent over a cup of coffee!!! We have always enjoyed  the little heaven that is a coffee shop.</p>

    <p>We married in 1979 , on the 4th anniversary of our first date and were soon blessed with 2 incredibly wonderful, beautiful daughters Kristi Michele and Jamie Nicole.  They are our greatest accomplishment and the center of our lives. Everything we do has them in mind. Incredibly, our girls married young men that have been close friends for most of their lives. They live near each other and raise their children together. Kristi and Kevin have given us 5 amazing grandchildren...Ethan, Tyler, Chloe, Peyton and Delaney! Jamie and Jon have given us 2 equally amazing grandchildren..Austin and Briana!</p>

    <p>Both of us have been part of the corporate world and are glad to now be doing what makes us happy. Jim was employed by CME Group and Barbe was an Allstate agency owner. We purchased a home in Lakes of the Four Seasons in 2007, and from day one, we wanted to sell our Wheaton, Il home and make this our primary residence. We love everything about the LOFS lifestyle. The only problem is that there were no  coffee shops for miles and nothing open early enough for us early risers. It was a constant topic of discussion for us. When some changes needed to be made in our lives, we literally looked at each other and said "we need to open a coffee shop!" It was that simple... And here we are, embarking on our dream second careers.</p>

    <p>In coming up with a plan, a name, a concept; one idea was overwhelmingly appealing to us. We want a place where families are welcome, along with busy commuters. If you want to grab a cup of your favorite morning beverage and a pastry and be on your way, we are here for you. If you are like us and want a place where you can gather with family and friends, make new friends, work over a cup of coffee or tea or just relax, we want to be that place you love to go to. We want you to tell us how to make your day start right!</p>

    <p>With our deep love for our family and our strong family values, we wanted to come up with a name that says who we are. We will share this journey with our children and grandchildren , when time permits them to be with us,and we wanted them included in our name. These 2 couples and 7 children are our inspiration ..... And that is why we are 2&amp;7 Coffee Bar!</p>
